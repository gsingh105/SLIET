<p>SLIET offers 7 different departments, which are-:
<p><a href="http://cs.sliet.ac.in/">(a)Computer Science</a> 
</p>
<p><a href="http://mech.sliet.ac.in/">(b)Mechanical Engineering</a>
</p>
<p><a href="http://ece.sliet.ac.in/">(c)Electronic Engineering</a>
</p>
<p><a href="http://eie.sliet.ac.in/">(d)Electrical Engineering</a> 
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">(e)Food Engineering</a>
</p>
<p><a href="http://fet.sliet.ac.in/">(f)Chemical Engineering</a>
</p>
<p><a href="http://eie.sliet.ac.in/">(g)Instrumentation and Control Engineering</a>
</p>
<br>
<p>Each department has dedicated labs for numerous technical and procedural operations, so students are encouraged to attend these laboratories and gain experience from there. The Computer Science Department has a well-resourced High-Performance Computing Lab, Linux Lab, Microprocessor Lab, Emerging Technology Lab, Desktop Publishing Lab, Networking lab, etc. Same way, The Chemical Department has its CRE and Thermodynamics Lab, Energy Technology Lab, Paper Technology Lab, Polymer Processing Lab, and several other labs too. The Mechanical Department brings to you exposure to some of the highly advanced Precision Metrology & Measurement Labs, CAD/ CAM Lab, Industrial Automation And Mechatronic Lab, Material Testing Characterization And Research Lab, Strength of Materials Lab, I.C ENGINE, AND Thermal Engineering Lab. The Electronics and Electrical Departments, which are often confused by some people find their refining when we examine how different the activities and technologies are present in both branches. Broadband Photonics Communication Lab, Digital System Design Lab, Digital Signal Processing Lab, Electromagnetic measurement and testing Lab, Microprocessor and Microcontroller Lab, Microwave Engineering Lab, Printed Circuit Board Lab, and Industrial Electronics Lab are some of the laboratories that are present in the Electronics and Communication department, while The Electrical and Instrumentation Department have labs such as Basic electrical engineering laboratory, Center for training and research in automation ( automation laboratory), Process control laboratory/ hydraulic and pneumatic laboratory, Control engineering laboratory, Data acquisition, and virtual Instrumentation laboratory, Digital electronics laboratory, Digital signal processing laboratory, Electrical machine laboratory. Even for Food Technology, the institute owns tooled-up labs like Rheology Lab, Food Engineering Lab, Food Biotechnology Lab, Packaging and storage Lab, Quality control Lab, Unit Operation Lab, Fruits & Vegetable Lab, and Dairy Technology Lab.</p>
